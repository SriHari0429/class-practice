    <h3>Pizza</h3>
    <p>pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough 
        topped with some combination of olive oil, oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella 
        or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, 
        in a commercial setting, using a wood-fired oven heated
        to a very high temperature—and served hot></p>

    <h3>Burger</h3>
  <p>There are many kinds of crave worthy foods. From foods
    that are sweet and salty to savory, there is one crave-able item that sure
    gets consumers talking. National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, a contractor 
    to the Beef Checkoff, recently conducted research on consumer preferences 
    for burgers when dining out. Consumers’ own words highlight just how 
    enticing burgers are for them.

    <h3>Pasta</h3>
    <p> I have lot of favorite foods but the one thing I like most is the Fettuccine Alfredo
        Pasta. Every time I taste the pasta, it makes so happy because of its juiciness and
        tenderness. It is so delicious because the alfredo sauce has mix with creamy and      
        buttered. The flavor has a hint of seasonings. When I eat the pasta, I feel calm and     
        it’s like a restaurant quality. It’s so hot because the fettucine is grainy and smooth    
        together with a warm creamy sauce. The smell of the pasta is sensational. It    
        cooked with a fresh garlic, heavy cream and white pepper. It baked with melted    
        butter with olive oil. It’s excellent to stir the fettuccine often. I hear the pasta    
        sounds quite original and authentic. The fettuccine itself is said to be chewy.   
        Together with the alfredo sauce is squishy and squeaky. It’s soggy when it’s done  
        cooking and steaming with the boiling water. When I see the pasta, it looks  
        heavenly. The alfredo sauce is Italian because it was created by restaurateur,  
        Alfredo di Lello. The reason the sauce is white because it’s made with melt butter, 
        garlic, heavy cream, pepper, salt and parmesan cheese. The pasta makes it rich when 
        stirs the noodles and the sauce together. Sometimes, it’s dry when it starts to get 
        warm or cold later by the minute. </p>
